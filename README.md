Project 6 - Data Visualization using Tableau

This project, I will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Why this Project?
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization,
Such as:
•	Visualization is a dialog
•	Showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
•	Visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements.

What I learn?
I able to:
•	Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
•	Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
•	Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau

Why is this Important to my Career?
Data analyst are storytellers that can translate data findings that other people can easily understand. They view data visualization as an important form of communication. As a data analyst, I can create visualizations to explore data, articulate clear findings to drive business decisions, or use data to elicit consensus from diverse perspectives.

Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually you’ll want to submit your project and share it. To do so, you need to create a zip folder that includes the following:

links to your Tableau Public workbooks, published online, and a write-up with four sections. See HERE if you need help publishing your Tableau Public Workbook.
Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization
Data Files
the final data set used to create the visualization (usually .csv, .tsv, or .json file)
a codebook or other files related to the data set (description, readme, license)
Step Three - Find a Data Story
Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data! Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the comparison(s) or relationship(s) you want your readers to see. Remember that you will ultimately need to create a visualization that is explanatory, helping lead a reader to identify one or more key insights into the dataset. Feel free to use whatever visualization and data analysis tools you feel comfortable with using at this point in the process.
